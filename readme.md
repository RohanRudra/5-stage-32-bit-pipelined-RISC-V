# ⚙️ 5-Stage 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V Processor

## 📘 Overview
This project implements a **5-stage 32-bit pipelined RISC-V CPU** based on the RV32I instruction set architecture.  
The pipelined design improves instruction throughput by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions, dividing the process into five sequential stages:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)** – Fetches the instruction from instruction memory.  
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)** – Decodes the instruction and reads operands from the register file.  
3. **Execute (EX)** – Performs arithmetic or logic operations using the ALU.  
4. **Memory Access (MEM)** – Accesses data memory for load/store operations.  
5. **Write Back (WB)** – Writes computation or memory results back to the register file.

## 🧪 Simulation & Testing
All stages were verified using **Icarus Verilog** and **Modelsim** for waveform visualization.  
- End-to-end verification was done using compiled **C programs → Assembly → Binary** execution.  
- Waveforms confirm correct data forwarding, hazard detection, and stall insertion.
